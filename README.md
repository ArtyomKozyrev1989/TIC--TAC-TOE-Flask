# TIC-TAC-TOE-Flask

This is Flask version of TIC TAC TOE game, no JavaScript is used.

The project was made for fun, as usual feel free to use the code. I'll be happy if somebody learn from the project.

To use the program, download all files (note: do not change folder structure) then install the following libraries:
wtforms, flask_wtf, flask

The program was made in Windows, but can be used in other OS.
